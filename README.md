* This is implementation of a image caption generator which generates a caption based on the things that are present in the image. Image captioning is a challenging task where computer vision and natural language processing both play a part to generate captions. This technology can be used in many new fields like helping visually impaired, medical image analysis, geospatial image analysis etc.

### Use cases
* Some detailed usecases would be like an visually impaired person taking a picture from his phone and then the caption generator will turn the caption to speech for him to understand. Doctors can use this technology to find tumors or some defects in the images or used by people for understanding geospatial images where they can find out more details about the terrain.
